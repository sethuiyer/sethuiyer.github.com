# Phase Transitions

## In Plain English

Water turning to ice is a phase transition. The same substance, the same chemical formula, but at certain temperatures, the entire character of the system changes — from a fluid where molecules slide past each other to a solid where they're locked in place.

Constraint satisfaction problems have phase transitions too. At certain problem densities, the solution landscape goes from "easy to find a solution" to "almost certainly no solution exists" — and crucially, in the transition zone, the landscape shatters into countless disconnected pieces. This is the hardest region to solve.

**Why this matters**: Detecting phase transitions lets you know when you're approaching the hard region. Navigating them lets you escape the shattered landscape. The Arithmetic Manifold does both.

## The SAT Phase Transition

For random K-SAT with $K=3$:

$$\alpha \approx 4.27 \text{ clauses per variable}$$

| Regime | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| $\alpha < 4.2$ | Almost all formulas are satisfiable; solutions are easy to find |
| $\alpha \approx 4.27$ | **Phase transition** — solutions exist but are hard to find |
| $\alpha > 4.3$ | Almost all formulas are unsatisfiable |

The phase transition is marked by the **appearance of a giant connected component** in the solution space, surrounded by exponentially many small clusters. This fragmentation is what makes problems hard.

## Thermodynamic Fracture

BAHA introduces the concept of **thermodynamic fracture** — when the solution landscape shatters at the phase transition.

The fracture detector monitors:

$$\rho(\beta) = \left| \frac{d}{d\beta} \ln Z(\beta) \right|$$

When $\rho$ exceeds a threshold, the system has entered the fractured regime:

```
Low ρ (smooth landscape)     High ρ (fractured landscape)
─────────────────────         ─────────────────────────────
Single basin                  Many disconnected basins
Gradient descent works        Gradient descent gets stuck
Convex optimization           Non-convex nightmare
```

## The Lambert W Function

The exit from the strongly convex regime is governed by the **Lambert W function** — the inverse of $f(w) = w e^w$.

The critical condition:

$$C = \frac{4\delta^2}{k_{max}^2 \cdot d_{clause} \cdot \beta}$$

The critical problem size $K^*$ at which phase transition occurs:

$$\ln K^* = -C \cdot W\left(-\frac{1}{C}\right)$$

**The ln K / ln ln K scaling** is a fingerprint of prime-weighted systems — no other weighting function produces this exact asymptotic.

### The Two Branches

The Lambert W function has two real branches:

- **$W_0(z)$** (principal branch): Small arguments, smooth basin transitions
- **$W_{-1}(z)$** (secondary branch): Large arguments, escape from deep local minima

BAHA uses both branches:
- $W_0$ for normal operation
- $W_{-1}$ for escaping fractured basins

## Phase Transitions Across Projects

### BAHA

BAHA detects fractures via $\rho(\beta)$ and uses Lambert W branches to enumerate new basins. When the landscape fractures, BAHA jumps to a different basin rather than trying to climb out.

### NitroSAT

NitroSAT embeds the critical $\beta$ scaling:

$$\ln K^* = -C \cdot W\left(-\frac{1}{C}\right)$$

This tells the solver when to switch from spectral initialization to BAHA-powered repair.

### Navokoj

The adiabatic quench schedule:

$$\beta(t) = \beta_0 + r t$$

is designed to pass through the phase transition slowly — adiabatic meaning "slow enough to stay in equilibrium."

### Spectral-Multiplicative Framework

The heat kernel $e^{-tL}$ smooths the landscape near phase transitions, acting as a **preconditioner** that makes the transition less severe.

## Why Phase Transitions Matter

Phase transitions are simultaneously:

1. **The source of hardness** — The fractured landscape has exponentially many local minima
2. **A source of signal** — The fracture detector $\rho(\beta)$ tells you exactly when you're in trouble
3. **A design opportunity** — By knowing where the phase transition is, you can design algorithms that handle it specifically

Standard simulated annealing ignores phase transitions — it just cools down and hopes for the best. BAHA **detects and targets** the phase transition directly.

## Key Insight

The phase transition is not a bug — it's a feature. The Arithmetic Manifold treats phase transitions as **landmarks** to be detected and navigated, not obstacles to be avoided. The Lambert W function provides the exact geometry of the fracture, giving BAHA a precise map of the solution space topology.
