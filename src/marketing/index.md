# Navokoj — Verifiable MaxSAT for Hard Planning Problems

**The shortest description:** Navokoj is a constraint-solving API that returns the best possible answer **plus a proof you can verify offline**.

---

## What Navokoj Solves

Every enterprise solves constraint-satisfaction problems under time pressure. Navokoj handles the ones where:

- The problem is **structured** (regular schedules, grids, hardware circuits, large graph partitions — not random SAT)
- **Speed matters** (real-time decisions, batch re-runs, what-if analysis)
- **Verifiability matters** (regulated industries, audit trails, security-sensitive workflows)
- **Disruptions happen** (a nurse calls in sick, a truck breaks down, a GPU fails) and you need to repair without restarting

If that sounds like your problem, [read the use cases](use-cases.md).

## The Three Things That Make Us Different

### 1. Proofs, not promises

Every Pro+ response includes a structured **proof artifact** — assignment + UNSAT cores + derivation graph. Our verifier is [open source](../glossary.md#verification--trust). You don't trust us. You download our verifier, run it against our response, and confirm offline. That is the trust model.

For comparison: classical solvers (Gurobi, CPLEX, OR-Tools) give you an answer and ask you to take it on faith. CDCL SAT solvers (Z3, Kissat, CaDiCaL) give you proof artifacts but choke on million-variable industrial problems. We do both.

### 2. Lock-preserving repair

When the world changes, we don't restart from scratch. We preserve the parts of your schedule that already work and adjust only what changed. **847×–12,495× faster than recomputation**, with 95%+ of prior decisions untouched.

This is the wedge for [hospital scheduling](use-cases.md#2-healthcare-workforce-scheduling), [fleet routing](use-cases.md#1-logistics--transportation), and [GPU cluster allocation](use-cases.md#3-cloud-infrastructure--devops).

### 3. Honest numbers, everywhere

We benchmark against certified optimal solutions and report the gaps. Our [`mini` engine](../limitations.md) hits 99.77% satisfaction; we tell you that's not 100%. We tell you where our solver plateaus (expander graphs, ~90% wall) and where it doesn't apply (random unstructured SAT). [Read the limitations page](../limitations.md).

| **Fluid simulation** | 2D Navier-Stokes | 99.64% residual reduction, 100,000× faster than CFD |

### Production performance (live API, 2026-04-04 → 2026-06-19)

> **308 production runs. 3.98M clauses processed. Median satisfaction 1.0. Median solve time 65.5 ms.**

| Production instance | Scale | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Largest clause-density ever recorded** | 10K vars / 1.65M clauses (165× ratio) | 100% in 278 seconds |
| **Sub-second structural monster** | 2.5K vars / 122K clauses (49× ratio) | **100% in 0.296 seconds** |
| **Massive variable count** | 49K vars / 73.5K clauses | 100% in 0.291 seconds |
| **Quality at scale** | 308 production runs | 79.87% at ≥99% satisfaction; 54.22% perfect |

These are not benchmark suite numbers. They are what real customers ran through the Navokoj API over 77 days. Full ledger with all 13 monster runs and the three-modes analysis: [NitroSAT production data →](../projects/nitrosat.md#production-performance--supabase-ledger-2026-04-04--2026-06-19)

## What It Is Not

- **Not a general SAT solver.** If your problem is random Boolean SAT at the phase transition, use Z3 or Kissat. We win on weighted, structured MaxSAT.
- **Not a ZK proving system.** Zero-knowledge is a 2027+ wedge that builds on top of our solver. The proof artifact today is a derivation graph, not a SNARK.
- **Not a real-time control system.** Our fastest engine hits ~94% satisfaction in milliseconds. If you need <10ms deterministic response for embedded control, look elsewhere.
- **Not a generic constraint solver for continuous problems.** If your objective is differentiable, use gradient descent. We specialize in discrete commitment allocation.
