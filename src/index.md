ShunyaBar Labs builds **Navokoj** — an industrial SAT / MaxSAT engine that replaces combinatorial search with **continuous phase transitions** grounded in non-commutative geometry. Our [spectral-arithmetic framework](projects/spectral-multiplicative.md) handles million-clause industrial instances in seconds, with **downloadable proof artifacts** so you can verify every assignment offline. We are a research lab and a product company: open preprints on [Zenodo](zenodo/index.md), a production API at `navokoj.shunyabar.foo`, and six shipped projects — all unified by one theory, the **Arithmetic Manifold**.

## Why approximate MaxSAT matters

Real systems are often overconstrained: every hard rule, cost target, preference, and safety condition cannot always be satisfied at once. SAT asks whether every constraint can be made true. MaxSAT asks for the best tradeoff when that is impossible: which assignment satisfies the most valuable constraints, and which violations remain.

Approximate MaxSAT is useful because exact optimality can be too expensive at industrial scale. A fast solver that returns a high-quality assignment, the violated clauses, reproducible objective values, and proof or audit artifacts can turn messy scheduling, placement, planning, verification, and policy-routing problems into practical optimization workflows.

| Path | Read this if… |
|---|---|
| [**Navokoj Launch**](blog/navokoj-launch.md) | You want product context first — what the solver does, how it performs. |
| [**The Arithmetic Manifold**](core-vision.md) | You want the math — how prime weighting, phase transitions, and Bost-Connes truncation compose into one theory. |
| [**Quick Start**](getting-started/quick-start.md) | You want to send a problem to the API in the next ten minutes. |

## NitroSAT — open-source benchmarks

[**NitroSAT**](projects/nitrosat.md) is the open-source solver (Apache 2.0) that backs Navokoj's [`pro` engine](glossary.md#engines-the-spectrum). The full benchmark suite — **358 instances across 19 problem types, every result reproducible from the attached code** — ships inside the [NitroSAT Zenodo record](zenodo/nitrosat-physics-informed-maxsat.md).

| 358 | 19 | 99.58% | 354,890 | 0.0000% |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| benchmark instances | problem types (graph coloring, Ramsey, scheduling, N-Queens, XOR-SAT, mutilated chessboard, …) | average clause satisfaction | clauses solved at 100% on `cliquecol` | std-dev across 20 variable renumberings (perfectly permutation-invariant) |

Verified instances include `129sat_n200` (1M clauses, 100%), `pyth_n5000` (100%), `ramsey_n52` (100%), `3sat_100k` (94.9%). Independent verification: `python3 verify_reproducibility.py`.
