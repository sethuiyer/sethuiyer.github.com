# ShunyaBar Labs — Product Strategy, H2 2026

**Author:** CPO
**Status:** Decision document. Not a wishlist.

**Anchored in:** 60+ live API tests, MSE 2022 benchmark validation, depth-4 Merkle root-cause diagnostic, engine spectrum analysis.

---

## 1. State of the Union (What We Actually Know)

### What Works Today

- Navokoj API live and stable: `/v1/solve`, `/v1/diagnose`, hybrid XOR+CNF modes, batch, Q-SAT (N-ary)
- Engines form a real spectrum: nano (94% / 870ms) → nitro (99.4% / 830ms) → pro (99.4% / 0.1–7s) → mini (99.77% / 40s+)
- Per-instance engine choice matters: pro beats nitro on multi-constraint chains; mini is the high quality fallback
- Soundness preserved: UNSAT detection is correct on certified benchmarks (8/10 MSE 2022 WCNF matched optimal)
- Honest limits: 1,000 vars / 5,000 clauses / 100 req/hr on free tier

### What Doesn't Work Today

- **Depth-4+ ZK Merkle paths fail across every engine.** Root-caused: not the mult chain (engine handles it in 150ms when exactly-one is removed), it's the one-hot "exactly-one" constraints choking local search at this constraint density
- **No real ZK customer can use us.** 254-bit field circuits need 254 Boolean vars per R1CS var — 25M+ vars for a typical circuit, vs our 1K ceiling
- **No native modular arithmetic at the API.** Everything goes through CNF enumeration, which doesn't scale
- **Gadget-layer quality is on the user.** Bit-blasting, witness extraction, and ZK framing are the user's problem today

## 2. The Honest Product Read

We're not a ZK company. We're a local-search MaxSAT engine company with a ZK-shaped marketing layer.

The engine is real and interesting — hybrid systematic+local-search is genuinely a research contribution. But the ZK framing is aspirational, not operational. Three reasons:

1. **Tier math doesn't work.** Real ZK needs 10⁶–10⁸ Boolean ops per proof. Our free tier is 5×10³ clauses. That's 5 orders of magnitude off.
2. **Latency math doesn't work.** Real ZK proofs need <1s. Our pro engine hits 7s on small chains. mini takes 40s+.
3. **Soundness UX doesn't work.** The 99.4% accuracy on single-shot means ~0.6% of proofs are wrong. For ZK that's catastrophic. mini gets to 99.77% but at 40s — still wrong 0.23% of the time, and 40s is unusable for proving.

The ZK story isn't dead — it's a **2027+ bet**, contingent on getting to 100% with a verifiable certificate (which nitro+local-search can't give).

## 3. Where We Play (Positioning)

Three plausible wedges. Pick one, kill the others.

### Wedge A: "The Verifiable MaxSAT API" ✓ Primary

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Sell Navokoj as a MaxSAT solver with optional proof-of-optimality (UNSAT core + assignment witness) |
| **Why** | Crowded field (MaxHS, SATLike, RC2) but our engine is competitive on speed/quality, and the proof artifact is a real differentiator |
| **Customer** | Decision optimization teams, scheduling, planning systems, ML feature selection |
| **Price** | Free tier → Pro $499/mo (500K clauses) → Enterprise $5K/mo+ (custom) |
| **12-mo ARR target** | $300K (60 enterprise customers, conservative) |

### Wedge B: "ZK Pre-Processor" ✓ Secondary

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Don't solve ZK. Be the best-in-class offline gadget that decomposes a ZK circuit into MaxSAT-shaped subproblems |
| **Why** | Every ZK project has a gadget bottleneck (hash functions, range proofs, lookups). We can be useful without being the proving system |
| **Customer** | ZK circuit engineers, snarkjs/gnark users, audit teams |
| **Price** | Per-circuit pricing, $50–$500 per decomposition |
| **12-mo ARR target** | $150K (low base, but real ZK $ flow) |

### Wedge C: "Hybrid AI Inference Routing" ❌ Kill

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Local-search for fuzzy/cost-sensitive decisions, fallback to exact solver for verification |
| **Why** | Real demand, but <50ms p99 latency required — we can't deliver this today |
| **Customer** | Robotics, real-time bidding, ad ranking, supply chain |
| **Verdict** | Kill for now — it's a feature, not a company |

### Wedge Evaluation: CENTS Test

| Wedge | Control | Entry | Need | Time Leverage | Scale | Score |
|-------|---------|-------|------|--------------|-------|-------|
| **Scheduling / Timetabling** | High | Medium | Very High | High | High | **Strong** |
| **ZK Pre-Processor / Auditing** | Medium | High | High | Medium | Very High | Good |
| **Agent Guardrails** | Medium | Low | Medium | High | Medium | Weak — kill |

**Scheduling wins.** Clear pain, paying customers who understand value immediately, strongest proof point (80M clauses in 73s).

## 4. The Proof-of-Optimality API Contract

### Design Principles

The `proof_artifact` is the core technical moat. **Schema rules:**

1. **Weights must be positive integers.** Floats create precision issues that make `primal_cost == dual_lower_bound` true by accident. Fractional weights invalidate the optimality certificate.
2. **Derivation graphs, not strings.** `resolution_chain` must be a structured derivation tree — clause IDs and resolution steps. The verifier reconstructs the proof, not parses English.
3. **Three response cases.** Optimal, feasible-with-gap, infeasible. The client must be able to distinguish all three.

### POST `/v1/solve` Request Payload

```json
{
  "num_vars": 8,
  "clauses": [
    [1, 2],
    [-1, 3],
    [-2, -3],
    [4, 5],
    [-4, 6],
    [-5, -6],
    [7, 8],
    [-7, -8]
  ],
  "weights": [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1, 1],
  "engine": "pro",
  "timeout_budget_seconds": 5.0,
  "generate_proof": true
}
```

> **Note:** `weights` must be positive integers. The WCNF format requires integer arithmetic for the dual bound to be mathematically sound.

### Response: Optimal Case

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "satisfiable": true,
  "satisfaction_rate": 0.875,
  "solve_time_seconds": 0.042,
  "engine_used": "pro-geometric-l4",
  "assignment": [true, false, true, true, false, true, true, false],
  "proof_artifact": {
    "primal_cost": 2,
    "dual_lower_bound": 2,
    "optimality_proven": true,
    "unsat_cores": [
      {
        "core_index": 0,
        "clause_ids": [6],
        "weight": 1,
        "derivation": {
          "type": "trivial",
          "input_clauses": [6]
        }
      },
      {
        "core_index": 1,
        "clause_ids": [7],
        "weight": 1,
        "derivation": {
          "type": "trivial",
          "input_clauses": [7]
        }
      }
    ],
    "verification_command": "navokoj-verify --assignment instance.assignment --wcnf instance.wcnf --proof proof.json"
  }
}
```

**Derivation types:**

| Type | Fields | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| `trivial` | `input_clauses: [id]` | Single unsatisfied clause is its own core |
| `resolution` | `left: core_id, right: core_id, resolvent: clause_id` | Multi-clause UNSAT core via resolution |

### Response: Infeasible Case (UNSAT)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "satisfiable": false,
  "satisfaction_rate": 0.0,
  "solve_time_seconds": 0.031,
  "engine_used": "pro-geometric-l4",
  "proof_artifact": {
    "dual_lower_bound": 10000,
    "infeasibility_proven": true,
    "hard_clause_unsat_core": [0, 1, 2],
    "derivation": {
      "type": "resolution",
      "left": {
        "type": "resolution",
        "left": {"type": "trivial", "input_clauses": [0]},
        "right": {"type": "trivial", "input_clauses": [1]},
        "resolvent": 10
      },
      "right": {"type": "trivial", "input_clauses": [2]},
      "resolvent": 11
    }
  }
}
```

> Hard clauses (weight = 0 in WCNF) form an unsatisfiable core. If the dual bound equals total hard weight, no feasible solution exists. This is critical for the audit wedge — clients must distinguish "optimal" from "infeasible" from "engine gave up."

## 5. Open-Source Strategy (Corrected)

### The Flaw in the Original Split

Putting proof generation in the closed layer is structurally weak. UNSAT core extraction is well-known — anyone with the open-source core can write their own. And "trust our closed-source proof checker" defeats the entire purpose of verification for security auditors.

### The Correct Split

| Layer | License | Contents |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Verifier + Proof Format** | **Open (Apache 2.0)** | Proof format spec, verifier implementation, example clients. Security auditors download this and run it offline. |
| **Engine Core** | **Open (Apache 2.0)** | Local-search relaxation loop, parsing, CNF/XOR primitives, basic heuristics. Community contribution path. |
| **Proof Generation** | **Closed (Commercial)** | Which search trajectories produce good UNSAT cores. Telemetry. RBAC + audit logging. On-prem runtime. Advanced ZK pre-processing heuristics. |

**Rationale:** The verifier being open-source is what makes the proof artifact trustworthy. "Download our open-source verifier, run it on the proof we gave you, confirm offline" — that's the security property the audit wedge requires. The closed layer is "our secret sauce for finding good proofs fast," not "our secret proof checker."

## 6. 12-Month Roadmap (Specific Bets, Dates)

### Q3 2026 (now → Sept)

- [ ] **Ship Wedge A MVP.** MaxSAT-first homepage, no ZK framing
- [ ] **Fix API schema.** Integer weights only, derivation graphs, infeasibility case
- [ ] **Pricing:** Lock Dev $99/mo, Pro $499/mo. Free tier → 500 req/hr
- [ ] **3 design partner LOIs signed** (1 per wedge we intend to keep)
- [ ] **First hire: Solutions Engineer** — 30-day plan: prospect list, pilot template, first 10 outreach calls
- [ ] **ARR target:** $20K (early enterprise pilots)

### Q4 2026

- [ ] Ship **Wedge B (ZK Pre-Processor)** sidecar
- [ ] **Proof-of-optimality artifact** in API response (UNSAT cores + derivation graph)
- [ ] **Open-source verifier + proof format** (Apache 2.0)
- [ ] Partner with snarkjs or gnark for "use NitroSAT as preprocessor" integration

- [ ] First paid ZK audit firm pilot (~$25K contract)
- [ ] **ARR target:** $250K cumulative

### Q2 2027

**Decision gate** — requires ALL three:
- [ ] 100% verifiable solver (mini audit: 40-60% there today)
- [ ] <1s p99 latency on depth-4-equivalent
- [ ] At least one paying ZK customer in production

**If yes:** Spin out "Shunyabar ZK" as separate product line
**If no:** Stay MaxSAT; revisit ZK in 2028

- [ ] **ARR target:** $500K cumulative

## 7. Hiring Sequence

> First hire is the bottleneck. Wrong first hire wastes 6 months.

| Hire | When | 30-Day Mandate | Why First |
|-------|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Solutions Engineer** | Q3, week 1 | 3 signed LOIs, pilot template ready, 10 enterprise outreach calls | Revenue requires someone who can sell + deliver. Not marketing, not engineering. |
| **DevRel** | Q4 | Open-source repo polished, SDK docs live, 3 community posts | Proof artifacts + open core need a community steward |
| **Backend Engineer** | Q4 | Metered billing, on-prem Docker, SSO/RBAC | Infrastructure for Enterprise tier |
| **ZK Engineer** | Q1 2027 | Partner integration (snarkjs/gnark), ZK preprocessor shipped | Only after ZK wedge validated |

**Don't hire:** ZK engineer in Q3. Premature. The ZK wedge isn't validated yet.

---

## 8. Pilot Template (Q3 Must-Have)

Every enterprise pilot follows this structure. Sales needs this ready before first outreach.

```
PILOT AGREEMENT
├── Problem: [What they're trying to solve]
├── Success criteria: [Measurable, e.g., "reduce scheduling compute time by 50%"]
├── Deliverable: [Proof-of-concept in 30 days, or full integration in 60 days]
├── Timeline: [Start date → demo date → decision date]
├── Pricing: [$X pilot fee, credited toward annual contract]
├── Payment: [Upfront, non-refundable]
└── IP: [Results belong to customer, we can use anonymized case study]
```

**Target pilots by Q3 end:**
- 1 scheduling / timetabling ($5K–$20K)
- 1 ML feature selection ($5K)
- 1 ZK preprocessor evaluation (free → paid conversion)

---

## 9. Kill List

Things we explicitly **are NOT** doing in the next 12 months:

| ❌ | Why |
|---|---|
| Real-time crypto / wallet / signing | Latency + audit surface |
| Build ZK DSL | Circom, gnark, Noir, ZoKrates are crowded. We integrate. |
| General SAT market | Z3, Kissat, CaDiCaL dominate. We're MaxSAT, not SAT. |
| Mobile / edge deployment | Engine footprint too big |
| Custom hardware (GPUs) | Research play, not 2027 product |
| ZK homepage framing | Until we have a paying ZK customer |
| Wedge C (Agent Guardrails) | CENTS test failed. Kill it. |

---

## 10. Pricing & Tier Strategy

| Tier | Price | Limits | Target |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1K vars, 5K clauses, 500 req/hr | Hobbyists, CI testing |
| **Dev** | $99/mo | 10K vars, 50K clauses, 5K req/hr | Indie devs, small apps |
| **Pro** | $499/mo | 100K vars, 500K clauses, 50K req/hr | Startups, mid-market |
| **Enterprise** | Custom $5K+/mo | Unlimited, on-prem optional | Large teams, regulated |

**Proof artifacts:**
- Free/Dev: assignment only (no proof)
- Pro+: assignment + UNSAT proof certificate + derivation graph
- Enterprise: + infeasibility proof when applicable

---

## 11. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| MaxSAT market commoditizes | Med | High | Open-source verifier + core; compete on proof artifacts + UX |
| ZK framing attracts wrong-fit customers | High | Med | Rebrand Q3; redirect to preprocessor |
| Engine accuracy claims don't hold | Med | Critical | Audit mini Q3; honest numbers if lower |
| Proof schema has bugs | High | Critical | Integer weights only; derivation graph not string; infeasibility case |
| Research team leaves | Low | Critical | Open-source verifier + core; reduce single-point-of-failure |
| Competitor ships 100% verifiable MaxSAT first | Med | High | Invest in proof artifacts NOW (Q3-Q4) |
| Funding / runway | Med | Critical | <$50K/mo burn; $300K ARR by end of 2027 |

---

## 12. The Single Most Important Thing

> **Get to 3 signed design partner LOIs by end of Q3.**

Everything else is feature roadmap. Revenue feedback is the only signal that validates wedges. The proof artifact, the API schema, the open-source split — none of it matters if we don't have paying customers in the loop by Q4.

**The sequence:**
1. Get LOIs first (Q3)
2. Then build the proof artifact (Q4)
3. Then open-source the verifier (Q4)

Not the other way around.

---

## 13. Honest Verdicts

1. **The ZK framing is hurting us.** Cut it from the homepage in Q3.
2. **The engine is real but undersold.** The hybrid local-search + systematic architecture is novel. Open-source verifier + core in Q4 to drive adoption.
3. **We're not a ZK company yet.** 2028+ if the verifiable proofs land. MaxSAT is now.
4. **First hire is Solutions Engineer.** Not DevRel, not ZK engineer. Revenue requires someone who can sell.
5. **The depth-4 Merkle result is research, not product.** Valuable IP. But nobody's paying for it yet.

---

*Assumptions: 1 founder + 4 hires by Q4, $300K seed extension in Q3, runway through Q2 2027.*
